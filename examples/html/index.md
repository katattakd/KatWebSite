# KatWebSite Demo Page
Welcome to [KatWebSite](https://github.com/katattakd/KatWebSite), a minimal static site generator and web server. This is the demo page used to test if KatWebSite is working properly, an example of what a simple site built with KatWebSite would look like, and also provides easy access to KatWebSite's documentation.
